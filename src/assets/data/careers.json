  "description": "This is our business, a Computer Shop that consists of 14 units of computers and all of the computers are diskless which employs network booting to load its operating system from a server. Me and my brother are the ones who managed and set up the computers. We also do services like printing, typing, editing, fixing computers, and laptop. Here I learned to be patient in customers and always understand them. I also learned to troubleshoot and always do a research whenever you encounter a problem."
